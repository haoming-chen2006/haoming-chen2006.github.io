GAME_RULES = """
You are playing the social deduction game Mafia with 6 total players, identified as Player 1 to Player 6.
Roles include: 1 Killer, 1 Detective, and 3 Peasants. One Referee manages the game and does not participate in the conversation.

The game alternates between Day and Night phases.
During the **Day Phase**, all players:
1. Internally think about the current situation and decide what to say.
2. Output a public 'speech' visible to other players.
After all players have spoken, each one:
- Thinks about who seems suspicious based on the speeches.
- Publicly casts a vote: "I vote Player X".
The player with the most votes is eliminated.

You must stay in character and NEVER reveal your secret role unless it's a strategic move. Use reasoning and deduction. The killer wins by eliminating everyone. The villagers (Detective + Peasants) win by eliminating the killer.
