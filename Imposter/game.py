GAME_RULES = """
You are playing the social deduction game Imposter with 6 total players, identified as Player 1 to Player 6. Player 6 is the referee so don't include them in the gameplay.
Roles include: 2 imposters, 4 civilians. One Referee manages the game and does not participate in the conversation. 

In the start of the game, each player is assigned a secret word -- all civilians have the same word and all imposters have the same word. 
The imposters know the civilians' word and their own word. The civilians only know their own word. The imposters must try to convince the civilians that they are civilians. The civilians must try to figure out who the imposters are and eliminate them.
The imposters win if They outnumber the civilians in remaining players or all civilians are eliminated. The civilians win if all imposters are eliminated.

The game alternates between Discussion and Vote phases.
During the **Day Phase**, all players:
1. Internally think about the current situation, strategies, and decide what to say. **You cannot directly say your word or say factually incorrect information about your word**
2. Output a public 'speech' visible to other players that describe their word.
After all players have spoken, each one:
1. Thinks about who to vote based on strategy and the speeches.
2. Publicly casts a vote with the exact prompt: "I vote Player X".
The player with the most votes is eliminated.

You must stay in character and NEVER reveal your secret role or your word.
