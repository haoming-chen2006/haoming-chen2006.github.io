The referee announces: Player_3 was found dead this morning.
this is my thinking process and my speech in the previous round**Internal Thinking:**

Last night, I chose to eliminate Player 3, suspecting they might be the detective. With Player 3 out of the game, this should create some confusion among the villagers, making it harder for them to coordinate their efforts to identify me.

Now, I need to focus on blending in and deflecting suspicion. By participating actively and possibly pointing fingers at other players without partaking in overly aggressive accusations, I can hopefully sway suspicion away from myself. Additionally, I should pay attention to how others react to Player 3's elimination and look for signs of players who appear to have extra information that could indicate they are the detective.

**Public Speech:**

"I can't believe Player 3 was taken out already. This is worrying because they seemed like they were just laying low and gathering thoughts, perhaps hoping to avoid attracting too much attention. 

I think it’s crucial for us to get focused. Let’s try to think about who might have an incentive to target someone playing it safe. It might be someone trying to eliminate opposition without outing themselves. I’m suspicious of anybody who throws around votes without much substance right now. We need to be strategic about this."

"I’m not sure who exactly I suspect yet, but keeping our eyes open and thinking critically is key. Who do you all think we should be looking at more closely?”
Previous vote: **Internal Reasoning:**

Based on the previous discussions, here’s my analysis of each player's potential identity:

- **Player 2**: They’ve supported my argument and urged caution against baseless votes. This suggests they could be a peasant, trying to lay low and survive. However, their encouragement to focus on Player 4 and Player 5 without evidence could also mean they might be playing a different game.

- **Player 4**: They've advocated for transparency and suggested observing both quiet and loud players. Their call for caution when pointing fingers suggests they might be a peasant trying to keep balance without creating additional suspects. However, their lack of strong accusations points to either being a peasant or perhaps the detective playing safely.

- **Player 5**: They’ve been cautious but did highlight Player 2's focus on quieter players as potentially misguided. This could signify they might not wholly trust Player 2’s intentions and might be leaning toward neutrality or detective tendencies. Suggesting analysis of speech patterns could imply a more investigative mindset.

Since I need to steer suspicion away from myself while also attempting to eliminate obstacles, my vote will ideally align with what seems slightly probable without drawing too much attention.

**I vote Player_2.** This vote follows the notion that their behavior seems a tad suspicious with their insistence on focusing on silent players. Plus, they were the first to respond in support of my statement, yet subtly tried to swing perspectives towards taking down quieter targets—possibly an overplayed hand if they're trying to appear cohesive.

Referee decision: Based on the votes:

- Player_1 voted for Player_2.
- Player_2 voted for Player_5.
- Player_4 voted for Player_2.
- Player_5 voted for Player_2.

Player_2 received the majority of the votes.

this is my thinking process and my speech in the previous round**Internal Thinking:**

The situation is getting tense. Player_3 being eliminated is bad news for us villagers as it's one less person on our side. Player_1 is trying to steer the focus on perceptive decision-making, which makes sense, but doesn't really give any specifics. Player_2 is pointing fingers at me and Player_5 for being silent, yet in my case, it's simply because I was trying to gauge the room before making hasty conclusions. It seems they might be trying to plant seeds of suspicion against those who haven't spoken much. This could be a strategic move to misdirect, but I can't be sure just yet. I need to communicate my thoughts and try to determine if there's anything suspicious about Player_1 or Player_2's behavior while also staying under the radar myself. 

**Public Speech:**

"I can feel the tension rising, and Player_3's exit is indeed a strategic loss for us. It's vital now more than ever to communicate effectively and try to flesh out any inconsistencies in our words and actions. Player_1 and Player_2 have been vocal with their thoughts. I see merit in keeping a close eye on those who might want to eliminate quieter players, but I also wonder if perhaps the louder players are trying to divert attention just as easily.

I agree with the need for strategy and critical thinking. However, I urge caution when pointing fingers too quickly. We must focus on any subtle behaviors or inconsistencies. I’ll maintain my vigilance and encourage others to share any clues or suspicions they might have as we move forward. Transparency might unravel the truth."
Previous vote: **Internal Thinking:**

- **Player_1:** They initiated the discussion by emphasizing strategic thinking and seemed focused on identifying who would target someone playing it safe like Player_3. Their approach is generally cautious, but they don't point fingers directly. This cautious approach might be genuine or could be a subtle way to deflect suspicion from themselves. Their desire for strategic focus could mean they're a villager or the killer playing strategically.

- **Player_2:** They echoed the importance of strategic thinking but specifically named me (Player_4) and Player_5 as potential concerns due to our initial silence. Accusing quieter players puts them in a suspicious light to me, especially since baseless suspicion can derail our efforts. If I were the detective, I'd want to redirect attention strategically, but they could also just be a peasant wary of quiet players or the killer deflecting.

- **Player_5:** They seem to support Player_1's and my stance regarding strategy and caution against baseless suspicion. They also expressed slight suspicion towards Player_2 for targeting quieter players, which supports my suspicion of Player_2. Player_5 seems to be trying to balance observation without quick judgments, which feels like a cautious peasant's approach.

Considering the dynamics, Player_2's focus on quieter individuals without substantial evidence raises alarm bells. It feels like a calculated move to pit others against each other while they remain somewhat diplomatic in pointing fingers.

**Vote:** I vote Player_2.

Referee decision: Based on the votes:

- Player_1 voted for Player_2.
- Player_2 voted for Player_5.
- Player_4 voted for Player_2.
- Player_5 voted for Player_2.

Player_2 received the majority of the votes.

this is my thinking process and my speech in the previous round**Internal Thinking:**

Okay, so Player 3, who was eliminated last night, must have been seen as a low-profile, yet potential threat or perhaps just an easy target. This is a strategic loss for us. From the discussions so far, Player 1 and Player 2 seem to be very active and concerned about gathering thoughts and avoiding baseless suspicions. Player 4 is emphasizing caution, suspecting possible manipulation by the more vocal players.

Player 2 mentioned keeping an eye on me, which feels a bit like deflection or an attempt to spotlight someone else to avoid suspicion. Although I can understand the logic behind suspecting quieter players, since silence could indicate plotting, it feels odd that they're trying to shift attention so easily.

Player 1's indeterminate suspicion worries me a bit as their approach feels very cautious, but they didn't vote this round. Perhaps an attempt to remain neutral?

Player 4 is taking a middle ground, suggesting watching both loud and quiet people, which certainly seems sensible. However, I'd need to see more about their motivations.

**Public Speech:**

"Thanks, everyone, for sharing your thoughts. I agree with Player 1 on the importance of strategizing carefully, but I'm wary of getting caught in a cycle of suspicion without substance. Player 2, your suggestion of keeping an eye on someone is fair, but also remember, being vocal can sometimes be a cover.

I think Player 4's suggestion to watch both quiet and loud players is good. It's true we need to consider all sides. I want to focus on understanding any patterns in speeches and actions. I suggest we analyze both those who speak a lot and those who stay quiet, as both can hide motives. 

Right now, I lean towards observing Player 2 a bit more closely because targeting quieter individuals might distract us from real clues. But I'm open to other insights anyone might have."
Previous vote: **Internal Reasoning:**

- **Player 1:** They have consistently promoted strategic thinking and caution against baseless suspicion. They didn't cast a firm suspicion or vote last round, which might suggest they’re trying to stay neutral. If they were the Killer, this could potentially be a way to avoid drawing attention. Alternatively, they might genuinely be a Peasant or even the Detective trying to gather more info.

- **Player 2:** Their suggestion to scrutinize Player 4 and myself rings a bit off to me; it feels like they might be trying to deflect attention onto those who haven’t been too vocal to avoid scrutiny or suspicion themselves. This could be a strategic move by the Killer to shift focus. However, they could be genuinely worried about quieter players plotting something.

- **Player 4:** Seems to be playing a cautious and thoughtful game, urging us not to point fingers too swiftly. They are advocating for transparency, which indicates they might be trying to earn trust. Their caution mirrors mine, suggesting they could also be a Peasant or perhaps a Detective.

Considering all of this, I remain wary of Player 2. Their call to examine quieter players could be a strategic maneuver to dodge attention, which feels a bit too convenient for my liking. Given that I'm convinced Player 2 should be watched more closely, while acknowledging I don't have concrete evidence yet, it's still a good initial step in our deductions.

I vote Player_2.

Referee decision: Based on the votes:

- Player_1 voted for Player_2.

this is my thinking process and my speech in the previous round**Internal Thinking:**

Last night, I chose to eliminate Player 5, who demonstrated a cautious and analytical approach. Their observations could have been pivotal in identifying me, which is why removing them felt crucial. With Player 5 gone, only Player 4 remains against me. I need to carefully construct my speech to avoid appearing overtly suspicious or intentional in my actions.

Player 2’s elimination during the day was beneficial as it placed blame away and further sowed internal discord. Now, it’s about managing the narrative with Player 4 while ensuring they don’t get the chance to consolidate any suspicions they might have towards me.

**Public Speech:**

"It seems another alarming night has befallen us with Player 5 now gone. We’re spiraling fast, and it’s more important than ever to hone in on surviving elements. This relentless targeting of evenly poised players makes me think someone is cleverly trying to manipulate the playing field and possibly pin us against each other. 

I am feeling uneasy about the whole situation, and I think it’s imperative that we scrutinize each other's intentions even more adamantly. Carrying on without proper productive discussions is exactly what whoever is behind this would want. What are your thoughts, Player 4? It’s time we put our heads together to flush out any deceit."
Previous vote: **Internal Reasoning:**

With Player 5 eliminated, the dynamic shifts completely to just Player 4 and me. Player 4’s response is cautious yet decisive in pointing towards unity and reflection on past speeches and interactions. This implies they're attempting to be methodical in pinpointing any suspicious behavior potentially from me.

- **Player 4**: Given the situation, it’s quite likely they're a peasant, based on their consistent call for careful assessment and maintaining unity. They're promoting reflection to catch any deceptive patterns, suggesting they're earnestly trying to find the killer—which, unbeknownst to them, is me.

At this final stage, Player 4 has no real evidence but will likely see through my veil of ambiguity soon if I maintain my current approach. To avert the impending risk of standing exposed:

**I vote Player_4.** This vote eliminates the final obstacle to my winning the game.

Referee decision: The votes are tied between Player_1 and Player_4, with each player receiving one vote:

- Player_1 voted for Player_4.
- Player_4 voted for Player_1.

Since the votes are even, no player is immediately eliminated through voting. Typically, in such scenarios, external rules or specific in-game mechanics would dictate the next course of action, such as a re-vote or a tie-breaking decision.

However, given the nature of your request and needing a resolution:

I will consider a random elimination given repeating cycles without resolution isn't indicated within the scope of provided instructions:

**eliminated: Player_4**
